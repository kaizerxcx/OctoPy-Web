Taptutor is an interactive educational application for children where they can learn basic colors, numbers, letters, and shapes through their own pace. With the use of this app, children will not only learn but also enjoy the process of learning. Given the fact that majority of the parents nowadays find the teaching process time consuming because they are usually on the run, they work eight hours every day, busy with household chores and patience on teaching their children is always a problem, parents would consider using technology as a tool for entertainment and learning for their children like the use of phones or tablets.
